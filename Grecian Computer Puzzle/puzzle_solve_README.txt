A short script in python to solve the Grecian Computer Puzzle. This script counts how many columns sum to 42 for each combination and prints the results. It can easily be edited to print out all 68 puzzle solves.

Note: Early versions of the Grecian Computer Puzzle have a misprint where an 8 is supposed to be a 3. This script has been corrected for this.
